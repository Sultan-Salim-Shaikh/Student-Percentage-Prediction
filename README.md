# Student Percentage Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
##  Objective 🎯 
The goal of this project is to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.

## Problem Statement ❓
Using Supervised Machine Learning predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they  have studied. 

## Tools 🛠 
1.Jupyter Notebook

2.Pandas 

3.NumPy

4.Matplotlib

5.Scikit-Learn

## Roadmap for Project 🛣
◾ This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.The steps involved are:

1.Loading/Importing the required libraries and Reading the data set

2.Plotting the Data 

3.Preparing the Data 

4.Dividing the Data for training and testing the model

5.Training the Algorithm

6.Visualizing the Model

7.Making Prediction

8.Evaluating the model using the given dataset

9.Evaluate the model for errors

10.Conclusion

## Conclusion 💡
◾ According to the model,we can conclude that if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day then the predicted score will be 93.69 %.
